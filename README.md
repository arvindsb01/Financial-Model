# Loblaws Limited Financial Model

This repository contains a comprehensive financial model built for **Loblaws Limited**. It includes a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation**, **Sensitivity Analysis**, and **Peer Comparison** to evaluate the company's intrinsic value and financial health.

## Project Overview

The model utilizes publicly available financial data and projections to calculate key financial metrics and derive the company’s valuation. It focuses on the following areas:

- **DCF Valuation**: Estimates the intrinsic value of Loblaws using **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** and **Terminal Value** calculations.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Examines how changes in key assumptions (like WACC, growth rates) impact the valuation.
- **Peer Comparison**: Benchmarks Loblaws against major competitors in the Canadian retail sector.
  
## Key Features

- **Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statements**: Historical and forecasted financial data used to build the model.
- **Forecasting**: Projected sales growth, EBITDA, and earnings per share (EPS) for the next 5 years.
- **WACC and Cost of Capital**: Calculation of the weighted average cost of capital using peer data and company-specific metrics.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Exploring the effects of various assumptions on the valuation outcomes.
  
## Getting Started

To run or modify this model, you will need the following:

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (for any scripting or data processing)
- **Excel** or **Google Sheets** (for financial data and templates)
- **Libraries** (if you're using Python for automation):
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical calculations
  - `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for data visualization
  
### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loblaws-financial-model.git
   ```
2. Open the **model** in your preferred tool (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) and follow the instructions for running the DCF and sensitivity analysis.
3. For Python users: The scripts in this repository include all necessary calculations, including DCF, WACC, and sensitivity analysis. To run the script, use the following:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

## Example Output

Here is a sample of the output you can expect from this financial model:
- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**: The model calculates the intrinsic value of Loblaws with projected free cash flows and terminal value.
- **Valuation Sensitivity**: The sensitivity table illustrates how variations in WACC and terminal growth rates impact the final valuation.
- **Financial Metrics**: Various performance metrics like EBITDA margin, net profit growth, and return on equity (ROE).

## Learning Sources

This financial model was developed with inspiration from **Parth Verma**'s *The Valuation School* YouTube channel, which provides in-depth tutorials on financial modeling and valuation. Additionally, **Murali Nishanth Kumar’s** work has motivated me to share this project for educational purposes.
